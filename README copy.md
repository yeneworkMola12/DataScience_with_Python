# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-SVM-Perceptron-and-Logistic-Regression-Models
 To classify the positive and negative movie reviews and to select the best model based on its accuracy , Logistic Regression, SVM and Perceptron models were developed and their accuracy was evaluated. Because computing large data set on a personal computer is computationally expensive,out of core learning  was employed.  The accuracy of the Logistic Regression, SVM and Perceptron models was found to be 86.7%, 87.0%, 84.5% respectively. Even though all the models have good accuracy. The SVM model, which has 87% accuracy is the best model to classify the movie review as positive and negative.
